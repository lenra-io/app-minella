### Single player

This game mode is just the classical minesweeper game.

### Versus

In this game mode, two players are fighting to get the highest score.
Each player starts with a score of 0 and win one point for each successfully revealed cell.
The players take turns and the flags are personnal.
If a player reveals a bomb he lose the game (or lose 10 points ?).
When all the cells are revealed minus the bomb ones the player with the highest score wins.
